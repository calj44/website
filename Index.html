<h1> Welcome to Calj Studio's </h1>
    <h2> Who we are</h2>
    <p>Here at Calj game studios we are developing the future of game design. We are working with top level developers to create new and exciting projects in the near future. We specialize in role playing games, family friendly games, and adventure games. Although we are a fairly new company we are currently developing several new games and intellectual properties we believe will reshape the future of gaming.</p>
    <p>Part of being a successful gaming company is being able to push the boundaries of the industry. Here at Calj Studios we believe in using the latest and greatest in developmental software which is why all of out games are developed in unreal engine 5. This allows us to create hyper-realistic games that blur the line between reality and games. We also believe in creating in depth and engaging stories. All of our games have professional staff with experience in creating popular award winning games, giving them the knowledge and skill to make next level games. </p>
    <h2>Core Values and beliefs</h2>
    <p>As a company we hold ourselves to a high standard. It is part of our core value and beliefs that no product we release is of poor quality. All games and developmental software that we release shall be released at the highest quality we can deliver. This means that we hold all of our products to the highest level of testing we can. This does mean that as a core belief we may delay a project rather than publish a project we are not proud of. Along with this we also believe as a core value in diversity and inclusion. As a company we hold a zero tolerance policy to any discrimination in any form. This includes in and out of the company. </p>
    <p>Our core beliefs as a company can be simplified in an acronym using our name C.A.L.J. C stands for care, everything we do is done with care and quality. A stands for appreciation, everything we do comes from a background of appreciation for the art and style of video games. As a company we believe it is vital to be made by gamers for gamers. L stands for love every product we make is expected to be a labor of love. lastly we have J which stands for justice, and by justice we mean that everyone is treated fairly. At calj studios we treat all reports of misconduct or discrimination in and out of our games seriously. We strive for a safe work environment and a safe world for people to explore and have fun playing in.</p>
