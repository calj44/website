		<h2>Our History</h2>
			<img src="history.jpg" alt="Calj Card Games Logo" width="200" height="200">
			<p>	Calj Studios was founded in 2019 originally as a trading card company. We developed the card game Eternal Flames back in 2019 which was discontined in 2022 after hardships during the pandemic. During this time we used the above image as our company logo before our rebranding in 2022.</p>
			<p>After our rebrand in quarter 2 of 2022 we went from primarily trading cards to video game development when we launched our first video game Kingdom of Dusk. Kingdom of Dusk is our first of many planned games that we shall develop here at Calj Studios. Since then we have begun the development of 4 new game IPs with different updates being posted here on our website.</p>
